Breast Ultrasound Image Analysis - Results and Insights!

I recently worked on a Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset, which contains 780 labeled ultrasound images of breast tissue, categorized into three classes: Benign, Malignant, and Normal. Each image is paired with its corresponding ground truth segmentation mask, making it ideal for both classification and segmentation tasks. This dataset is a valuable resource for advancing breast cancer research and improving diagnostic accuracy.

 Classification Results:
1️⃣ Using ResNet50, I achieved 88% validation accuracy, with the following F1 scores:

Benign: 90%
Malignant: 84%
Normal: 90%
2️⃣ I also experimented with a basic CNN, but it resulted in lower validation accuracy compared to ResNet50.

 Image Segmentation Results:
1️⃣ U-Net Model:

Validation Accuracy: 96%
Trained for 80 epochs
2️⃣ DeepLabV3+:

Validation Accuracy: 94.5%
Trained for 50 epochs
Note: Accuracy can be further improved with additional epochs.
